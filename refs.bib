        abstract = {Abstract. Volume visualizations can have drastically different appearances when viewed using a variety of transfer functions. A problem then occurs in trying to organize many different views on one screen. We conducted a user study of four layout techniques for these multiple views. We timed participants as they separated different aspects of volume data for both time-invariant and time-variant data using one of four different layout schemes. The layout technique had no impact on performance when used with time-invariant data. With time-variant data, however, the multiple view layouts all resulted in better times than did a single view interface. Surprisingly, different layout techniques for multiple views resulted in no noticeable difference in user performance. In this paper, we describe our study and present the results, which could be used in the design of future volume visualization software to improve the productivity of the scientists who use it.}
